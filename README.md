Python code is based heavily on work done by Alexander Cochran and Teckla Akinyi at Cincinnati Children's Medical Center.

Ventilator hardware is built based off of published designs from Duke University (John Nouls, Rohan Virgincar) and Cincinnati Children's Hospital (Zackary I. Cleveland, Teckla Akinyi).

Code is designed to run all ventilator valves and read a pressure transducer from a single arduino. Python code provides a simple user interface for setting respiration values and viewing pressure transducer output. Code is a work-in-progress and has not yet been fully tested.
